# Quick Testing Guide - Verification with Rejection Status

## Test the Updated Admin Controller

### Test 1: Approve a Provider
```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/admin/verify-provider \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": 1,
    "provider_isVerified": true
  }'

# Expected Response:
{
  "message": "Service provider approved successfully",
  "data": {
    "provider_id": 1,
    "provider_isVerified": true,
    "verification_status": "approved",
    "rejection_reason": null,
    "verification_reviewed_at": "2025-10-02T..."
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Reject a Provider with Reason
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/admin/verify-provider \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": 2,
    "provider_isVerified": false,
    "rejection_reason": "Certificate image is not clear. Please upload a higher quality scan."
  }'

# Expected Response:
{
  "message": "Service provider rejected successfully",
  "data": {
    "provider_id": 2,
    "provider_isVerified": false,
    "verification_status": "rejected",
    "rejection_reason": "Certificate image is not clear...",

}
```

### Test 3: Approve a Customer
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/admin/verify-customer \

## Verification Status Flow Testing

### Scenario 1: Complete Provider Verification Flow
1. Provider registers ‚Üí `verification_status: "pending"`
2. Provider submits documents ‚Üí `verification_submitted_at: [timestamp]`
3. Admin reviews and REJECTS ‚Üí `verification_status: "rejected"`, `rejection_reason: "..."`, `verification_reviewed_at: [timestamp]`
4. Provider fixes issues and resubmits ‚Üí `verification_submitted_at: [new timestamp]`
5. Admin reviews and APPROVES ‚Üí `verification_status: "approved"`, `rejection_reason: null`, `verification_reviewed_at: [timestamp]`

### Scenario 2: Complete Customer Verification Flow
1. Customer registers ‚Üí `verification_status: "pending"`
2. Customer submits ID ‚Üí `verification_submitted_at: [timestamp]`
3. Admin reviews and APPROVES ‚Üí `verification_status: "approved"`, `verification_reviewed_at: [timestamp]`

## Database Verification Queries

Check the changes directly in your database:

```sql
-- Check provider verification status
SELECT 
  provider_id,
  provider_first_name,
  provider_last_name,
  provider_email,
  provider_isVerified,
  verification_status,
  rejection_reason,
  verification_submitted_at,
  verification_reviewed_at
FROM "ServiceProviderDetails"
WHERE provider_isVerified = false;

-- Check customer verification status
SELECT 
  user_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  is_verified,
  verification_status,
  rejection_reason,
  verification_submitted_at,
  verification_reviewed_at
FROM "User"
WHERE is_verified = false;
```

## Common Rejection Reasons Examples

### For Providers:
- "Certificate image is not clear. Please upload a higher quality scan."
- "The certificate has expired. Please upload a valid, current certificate."
- "The name on the certificate does not match your registered name."
- "Missing required certificate for the services you're offering."
- "ID document photo is not legible. Please provide a clearer image."

### For Customers:
- "ID document photo is too blurry. Please upload a clearer image."
- "The ID document has expired. Please upload a valid ID."
- "The photo on the ID does not match your profile photo."
- "ID document type is not acceptable. Please upload a government-issued ID."
- "Full ID document is not visible. Please upload a complete image."

## Frontend Display Example

```javascript
// Display verification status badge
function VerificationBadge({ status, rejection_reason }) {
  const badges = {
    pending: { color: 'yellow', text: 'Pending Review', icon: '‚è≥' },
    approved: { color: 'green', text: 'Verified', icon: '‚úÖ' },
    rejected: { color: 'red', text: 'Rejected', icon: '‚ùå' }
  };

  const badge = badges[status];

  return (
    <div>
      <span className={`badge ${badge.color}`}>
        {badge.icon} {badge.text}
      </span>
      {status === 'rejected' && rejection_reason && (
        <div className="rejection-reason">
          <strong>Reason:</strong> {rejection_reason}
          <button onClick={handleResubmit}>Re-submit Documents</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## What to Check After Testing

‚úÖ **Provider Approval:**
- `provider_isVerified` is `true`
- `verification_status` is `"approved"`
- `rejection_reason` is `null`
- `verification_reviewed_at` has timestamp

‚úÖ **Provider Rejection:**
- `provider_isVerified` is `false`
- `verification_status` is `"rejected"`
- `rejection_reason` contains the reason
- `verification_reviewed_at` has timestamp

‚úÖ **Customer Approval:**
- `is_verified` is `true`
- `verification_status` is `"approved"`
- `rejection_reason` is `null`
- `verification_reviewed_at` has timestamp

‚úÖ **Customer Rejection:**
- `is_verified` is `false`
- `verification_status` is `"rejected"`
- `rejection_reason` contains the reason
- `verification_reviewed_at` has timestamp

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find provider/customer"
- **Check:** Verify the ID exists in the database
- **Check:** Ensure you're using the correct ID field (`provider_id` or `user_id`)

### Issue: Rejection reason not being saved
- **Check:** Make sure `rejection_reason` is included in the request body
- **Check:** Ensure `provider_isVerified: false` or `is_verified: false` is set when rejecting

### Issue: Old rejection reason still showing after approval
- **Fix:** The controller automatically sets `rejection_reason: null` on approval

## Summary

Your verification system now:
‚úÖ Uses existing Prisma schema fields
‚úÖ Tracks approval/rejection status
‚úÖ Stores rejection reasons for user feedback
‚úÖ Records review timestamps for audit trail
‚úÖ Clears rejection reason on approval
‚úÖ Returns detailed information including verification history
‚úÖ Provides proper error handling and status codes

No database migrations needed - it all works with your current schema! üéâ
