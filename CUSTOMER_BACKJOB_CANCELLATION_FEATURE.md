# Customer Backjob Cancellation Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability for customers to cancel their own backjob applications with reasons and email notifications, similar to appointment cancellation functionality.

## New Features Added

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added field**: `customer_cancellation_reason` to `BackjobApplication` model
- **Updated status**: Added `cancelled-by-customer` to valid backjob statuses
- **Migration created**: `add-customer-cancellation-reason`

### 2. API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/appointments/backjobs/:backjobId/cancel`
- **Authentication**: Customer JWT token required
- **Authorization**: Only the customer who created the backjob can cancel it
- **Validation**: Cancellation reason is required

### 3. Controller Function: `cancelBackjobByCustomer`
**Location**: `src/controller/appointmentController.js`

**Features**:
- Validates customer ownership of backjob
- Checks cancellable status (approved, pending, disputed)
- Updates backjob status to `cancelled-by-customer`
- **Warranty Resumption**: Resumes warranty from paused state
- Sends email notifications to both customer and provider

**Business Logic**:
```javascript
// Resume warranty from paused state when customer cancels backjob
if (appointment && appointment.warranty_paused_at && appointment.warranty_remaining_days !== null) {
    const now = new Date();
    const newExpiryDate = new Date(now);
    newExpiryDate.setDate(newExpiryDate.getDate() + appointment.warranty_remaining_days);

    await prisma.appointment.update({
        where: { appointment_id: backjob.appointment_id },
        data: {
            appointment_status: 'in-warranty', // Resume warranty period
            warranty_expires_at: newExpiryDate,
            warranty_paused_at: null, // Clear pause
            warranty_remaining_days: null
        }
    });
}
```

### 4. Email System Integration
**New Email Functions in `src/services/backjob-mailer.js`**:

#### Customer Confirmation Email (`sendBackjobCancellationToCustomer`)
- **Theme**: Grey-themed cancellation confirmation
- **Content**: 
  - Cancellation details with appointment and backjob IDs
  - Original issue and cancellation reason
  - Warranty resumption information
  - Clear next steps

#### Provider Notification Email (`sendBackjobCancellationToProvider`)
- **Theme**: Informational notification
- **Content**:
  - Customer cancellation details
  - Customer contact information
  - Status update information
  - No action required message

### 5. API Route Registration
**File**: `src/route/appointmentRoutes.js`
- Added import for `cancelBackjobByCustomer` function
- Registered route: `POST /backjobs/:backjobId/cancel`
- Applied authentication middleware

### 6. Documentation Updates
**File**: `BACKJOB_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

**Added Section**: `### 3. Cancel Backjob (Customer)`
- Complete API documentation with examples
- Request/response formats
- Error handling scenarios
- Business logic explanation
- Email notification details

**Updated Sections**:
- Renumbered subsequent API sections (4, 5, 6)
- Added backjob cancellation emails to email templates section
- Updated backjob status table to include `cancelled-by-customer`

## Usage Example

```bash
# Customer cancels their backjob
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/appointments/backjobs/123/cancel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <customer-jwt>" \
  -d '{
    "cancellation_reason": "Issue resolved itself after further inspection"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Backjob cancelled successfully by customer and warranty resumed",
  "data": {
    "backjob_id": 123,
    "status": "cancelled-by-customer",
    "customer_cancellation_reason": "Issue resolved itself after further inspection"
  }
}
```

## Warranty Management Integration
- **Pause System**: Works with existing warranty pause functionality
- **Resumption Logic**: Uses stored `warranty_remaining_days` to resume correctly
- **Status Flow**: `in-warranty` → `backjob` (paused) → `in-warranty` (resumed after cancellation)

## Error Handling
- **400**: Missing cancellation reason
- **403**: Unauthorized (not the customer who created the backjob)
- **404**: Backjob not found
- **400**: Invalid status (cannot cancel completed/already cancelled backjobs)

## Benefits
1. **Customer Control**: Customers can manage their own backjob requests
2. **Fair Warranty**: Warranty resumes from exact paused point
3. **Clear Communication**: Both parties receive appropriate notifications  
4. **Audit Trail**: Cancellation reason stored for record keeping
5. **Consistent UX**: Similar to appointment cancellation flow
