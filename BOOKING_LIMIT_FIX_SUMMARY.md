# Booking Limit Fix Summary

## Issue
The booking limit system was not working correctly because it was checking for the wrong appointment statuses.

**Previous (Incorrect) Statuses Checked:**
- `Pending`, `pending`, `accepted`, `approved`, `confirmed`

**Actual System Statuses:**
- `scheduled` ‚Üê Only this counts toward limit
- `on the way` ‚Üê Doesn't count
- `in-progress` ‚Üê Doesn't count
- `finished` ‚Üê Doesn't count
- `completed` ‚Üê Doesn't count
- `cancelled` ‚Üê Doesn't count

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed `createAppointment` Function
**File:** `src/controller/authCustomerController.js`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD - Checking multiple statuses
const scheduledStatuses = ['Pending', 'pending', 'accepted', 'approved', 'confirmed'];
const customerScheduledAppointments = await prisma.appointment.count({
    where: {
        customer_id: parseInt(customerId),
        appointment_status: { in: scheduledStatuses }
    }
});

// NEW - Only checking 'scheduled' status
const customerScheduledAppointments = await prisma.appointment.count({
    where: {
        customer_id: parseInt(customerId),
        appointment_status: 'scheduled'  // Only count 'scheduled' status
    }
});
```

### 2. Fixed `getCustomerBookingAvailability` Function
**File:** `src/controller/authCustomerController.js`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD - Checking multiple statuses
const scheduledStatuses = ['Pending', 'pending', 'accepted', 'approved', 'confirmed'];
const scheduledCount = await prisma.appointment.count({
    where: {
        customer_id: userId,
        appointment_status: { in: scheduledStatuses }
    }
});

// NEW - Only checking 'scheduled' status
const scheduledCount = await prisma.appointment.count({
    where: {
        customer_id: userId,
        appointment_status: 'scheduled'  // Only count 'scheduled' status
    }
});
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Both functions now include debug logging to help troubleshoot:

```javascript
// Shows all appointments for customer
console.log('üîç DEBUG - All customer appointments:', allAppointments);

// Shows scheduled count
console.log('üîç DEBUG - Scheduled count found:', scheduledCount);
```

### 4. Updated Documentation
**File:** `BOOKING_LIMIT_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`

- Updated status flow diagram
- Fixed error messages
- Corrected all examples
- Updated frontend integration code

---

## How It Works Now

### Appointment Status Flow

```
When appointment is created:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Status: 'scheduled' (counts toward 3-limit)

Provider updates status:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 'on the way' ‚Üí Slot freed, customer can book again
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 'in-progress' ‚Üí Slot freed, customer can book again
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 'finished' ‚Üí Slot freed, customer can book again
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 'completed' ‚Üí Slot freed, customer can book again
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 'cancelled' ‚Üí Slot freed, customer can book again
```

### Booking Limit Logic

| Scheduled Appointments | Can Book? | Available Slots |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 | ‚úÖ Yes | 3 |
| 1 | ‚úÖ Yes | 2 |
| 2 | ‚úÖ Yes | 1 |
| 3 | ‚ùå No | 0 |

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Customer's Current Status
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/auth/customer-booking-availability \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>"
```

**Expected Response (with 3 scheduled appointments):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "canBook": false,
    "scheduledCount": 3,
    "maxAllowed": 3,
    "availableSlots": 0,
    "message": "Booking limit reached. Please wait for an appointment to be completed or cancelled.",
    "scheduledAppointments": [
      { "appointment_id": 1, "status": "scheduled", ... },
      { "appointment_id": 2, "status": "scheduled", ... },
      { "appointment_id": 3, "status": "scheduled", ... }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Try to Book (Should Fail)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/appointments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": 123,
    "service_id": 456,
    "scheduled_date": "2025-10-15",
    "scheduled_time": "09:00"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Booking limit reached. You can only have 3 scheduled appointments at a time. Please wait for one of your appointments to change status (on the way, in-progress, completed, or cancelled) before booking again.",
  "currentScheduledCount": 3,
  "maxAllowed": 3
}
```

### 3. Update One Appointment Status
```bash
# Provider updates one appointment to 'on the way'
# (This would be done through provider endpoints)

# Then check availability again
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/auth/customer-booking-availability \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "canBook": true,
    "scheduledCount": 2,
    "maxAllowed": 3,
    "availableSlots": 1,
    "message": "You can book 1 more appointment",
    "scheduledAppointments": [
      { "appointment_id": 1, "status": "scheduled", ... },
      { "appointment_id": 3, "status": "scheduled", ... }
      // appointment_id 2 with status 'on the way' is not in this list
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Try to Book Again (Should Succeed)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/appointments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": 123,
    "service_id": 456,
    "scheduled_date": "2025-10-16",
    "scheduled_time": "10:00"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Appointment booked successfully",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Customer with 0 'scheduled' appointments can book (3 slots available)
- [ ] Customer with 1 'scheduled' appointment can book (2 slots available)
- [ ] Customer with 2 'scheduled' appointments can book (1 slot available)
- [ ] Customer with 3 'scheduled' appointments **cannot** book (0 slots)
- [ ] Error message displays correctly when limit is reached
- [ ] Status change from 'scheduled' to 'on the way' frees a slot
- [ ] Status change from 'scheduled' to 'in-progress' frees a slot
- [ ] Status change from 'scheduled' to 'completed' frees a slot
- [ ] Status change from 'scheduled' to 'cancelled' frees a slot
- [ ] `/customer-booking-availability` returns correct count
- [ ] Debug logs show correct appointment statuses

---

## Frontend Integration Update

If you have frontend code that checks appointment statuses, update it:

```javascript
// OLD - Checking multiple statuses
const isScheduled = ['pending', 'accepted', 'approved', 'confirmed']
  .includes(appointment.status);

// NEW - Only check 'scheduled'
const isScheduled = appointment.status === 'scheduled';
```

---

## Database Check

To manually verify in the database:

```sql
-- Check customer's scheduled appointments
SELECT 
    appointment_id,
    customer_id,
    appointment_status,
    scheduled_date
FROM Appointment
WHERE customer_id = <your_customer_id>
ORDER BY scheduled_date;

-- Count only 'scheduled' status
SELECT COUNT(*) as scheduled_count
FROM Appointment
WHERE customer_id = <your_customer_id>
AND appointment_status = 'scheduled';
```

---

## What Changed

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Status Check | Multiple statuses | Only 'scheduled' |
| Count Logic | `in: [array]` | Direct string match |
| Error Message | Generic | Specific status names |
| Documentation | Incorrect statuses | Correct statuses |
| Debug Logs | Minimal | Detailed |
