# Verification Fields Update Summary

## Overview
Updated all endpoints to include the new verification status fields from the database schema:
- `verification_status` - Current status: 'pending', 'approved', or 'rejected'
- `rejection_reason` - Reason provided when verification is rejected
- `verification_submitted_at` - Timestamp when verification was submitted
- `verification_reviewed_at` - Timestamp when admin reviewed the verification

## API Response Changes

### Before Update (User Profile Example):
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "is_verified": false
}
```

### After Update (User Profile Example):
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "is_verified": false,
  "verification_status": "rejected",
  "rejection_reason": "ID document is unclear",
  "verification_submitted_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "verification_reviewed_at": "2025-01-16T14:20:00Z"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can now see why their verification was rejected
2. **Improved Admin Workflow**: Admins can track when verifications were submitted and reviewed
3. **Enhanced Status Tracking**: Clear distinction between 'pending', 'approved', and 'rejected' states
4. **Audit Trail**: Timestamps provide accountability and tracking
5. **API Consistency**: All endpoints now return the same verification fields

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test User Profile Endpoints**
   - GET `/auth/user-profile/:userId` - Verify all fields are returned
   
2. **Test Provider Profile Endpoints**
   - GET `/auth/provider/profile` - Verify all fields are returned
   
3. **Test Admin Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/admin/users` - Check all users include verification fields
   - GET `/api/admin/users/:userId` - Check user details include verification fields
   - PUT `/api/admin/users/:userId/verify` - Verify status is set correctly
   - PUT `/api/admin/users/:userId/reject` - Verify rejection reason is saved
   - GET `/api/admin/providers` - Check all providers include verification fields
   - PUT `/api/admin/providers/:providerId/verify` - Verify status is set correctly
   - PUT `/api/admin/providers/:providerId/reject` - Verify rejection reason is saved

4. **Test Swagger UI**
   - Verify User and ServiceProvider schemas show new fields
   - Test API calls through Swagger to ensure documentation matches reality

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Maintained** - All existing fields remain unchanged:
- `is_verified` (for users)
- `provider_isVerified` (for providers)

The new fields are **additive only**, so existing clients will continue to work. New clients can use the enhanced verification fields for better user experience.

## Migration Notes

- No database migration needed - fields already exist in schema.prisma
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- All responses are backward compatible with additional fields
