# Testing the Fixed Calendar Functionality

## What was fixed:

1. **Removed Weekly Restriction**: The calendar was limited to only show current week dates
2. **Extended Date Range**: Now allows booking up to 8 weeks in advance
3. **Rolling Weekly Logic**: Each day rolls independently for recurring availability

## The Problem:
Before the fix, in `resetBookingForm()`:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC)
dateInput.max = endDateString; // Can't book beyond current week
```

## The Solution:
After the fix, in `resetBookingForm()`:
```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
const maxDate = new Date(today);
maxDate.setDate(today.getDate() + (8 * 7)); // 8 weeks from today
dateInput.max = maxDateString; // Can book up to 8 weeks in advance
```

## How to Test:

### 1. Open the Customer Dashboard
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/customer-dashboard`
- Login with customer credentials

### 2. Try to Book a Service
- Click on any service's "Book Now" button
- Look at the date picker in the booking modal

### 3. Test Date Selection
- **Before Fix**: Could only select dates from current week
- **After Fix**: Can select dates up to 8 weeks in advance

### 4. Verify Rolling Weekly Logic
- Select a Monday date 2 weeks from now
- Check that time slots show up (if provider has Monday availability)
- Select a different Monday 3 weeks from now
- Verify same time slots are available

### 5. Browser Console Test
You can also run this in the browser console:
```javascript
// Test calendar functionality
const dateInput = document.getElementById('bookingDate');
console.log('Min date:', dateInput.min);
console.log('Max date:', dateInput.max);

// Try setting a future date
const futureDate = new Date();
futureDate.setDate(futureDate.getDate() + 14); // 2 weeks from now
dateInput.value = futureDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
console.log('Successfully set future date:', dateInput.value);
```

## Expected Results:

✅ **Past dates**: Blocked (grayed out)
✅ **Today**: Available 
✅ **Future dates**: Available up to 8 weeks ahead
✅ **Rolling weekly**: Monday Week 1 ≠ Monday Week 2
✅ **No weekly restriction**: Can book beyond current week

## Key Benefits:

1. **Customer Experience**: Can book appointments weeks in advance
2. **Provider Flexibility**: Rolling weekly schedule works as intended
3. **No Artificial Limits**: Not restricted to current week only
4. **Intuitive Behavior**: Calendar works as customers expect

## Files Modified:

1. `src/public/js/customer-dashboard.js` - Fixed `resetBookingForm()` and `restrictCalendarToAvailableDays()`
2. `src/public/marketplace.html` - Updated date restrictions to be consistent

The calendar now properly supports the rolling weekly recurring availability system!
