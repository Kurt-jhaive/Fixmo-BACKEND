# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - Fix Authentication

## ✅ PROBLEM FOUND!

```
🔐 optionalAuth middleware - Authorization header: Present
❌ Invalid token - continuing as unauthenticated request
```

**The token is being sent but it's INVALID!**

---

## 🎯 THE FIX (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Logout from Your App
1. Open your app
2. Go to Profile tab  
3. Click "Logout"

### Step 2: Login Again
1. Enter your credentials
2. Login
3. You'll get a NEW valid token

### Step 3: Test
1. Search for any service (e.g., "PC Troubleshooting")
2. Should now show distance: "X km away" ✅
3. Should calculate locations properly ✅

**That's it! The old token doesn't match your current backend JWT_SECRET.**

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

Your stored token was created with a different JWT_SECRET than your current backend is using, OR it expired.

**Old token**: Created with `JWT_SECRET="old-secret"`  
**Backend now**: Using `JWT_SECRET="new-secret"`  
**Result**: Token invalid ❌

## ✅ After Logout + Login

### Backend Will Show:
```
✅ BEFORE (Invalid):
❌ Invalid token - continuing as unauthenticated request
🔐 Authentication: Not authenticated (public request)

✅ AFTER (Valid):
✅ Token valid - User authenticated
👤 User ID: 45
🔐 Authentication: Authenticated - User ID: 45
📍 Customer location: 14.5931372,120.9714012
 Distance: 1234.56 km ✅
```

### Frontend Will Show:
```
✅ Distance calculations working
✅ Providers sorted by nearest first
✅ "X km away" displayed on each provider
✅ Booked dates blocked in calendar
```

---

## � Quick Checklist

- [ ] Logout from app (Profile → Logout)
- [ ] Login again with credentials
- [ ] Search for "PC Troubleshooting"
- [ ] Check if distance shows: "X km away"
- [ ] Backend logs show: "✅ Token valid"

## 🆘 If Logout Button Doesn't Exist

Add this temporary code to clear storage:

```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { Alert } from 'react-native';

// Add this button temporarily
<TouchableOpacity onPress={async () => {
  await AsyncStorage.clear();
  Alert.alert('Done', 'Please restart app and login');
}}>
  <Text>Clear & Logout</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Then restart app with: `npx expo start -c`
