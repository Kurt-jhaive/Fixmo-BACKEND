# Report System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

The Report System has been successfully implemented and is ready to use!

### What Was Built

1. **Database Schema** ‚úÖ
   - Added `Report` model to Prisma schema
   - Migration applied: `20251012164602_add_report_system`
   - Fields: reporter info, report type, subject, description, priority, status, admin notes, attachments

2. **Email Service** ‚úÖ
   - File: `src/services/report-mailer.js`
   - `sendReportToAdmin()` - Sends report to admin with **replyTo field** for direct replies
   - `sendReportConfirmationToReporter()` - Confirms receipt to user
   - Professional HTML templates with priority badges and formatting

3. **API Controller** ‚úÖ
   - File: `src/controller/reportController.js`
   - 6 endpoints:
     - `submitReport()` - Public endpoint for submitting reports
     - `getAllReports()` - Admin: List all reports with filters
     - `getReportById()` - Admin: Get single report details
     - `updateReportStatus()` - Admin: Update report status and notes
     - `deleteReport()` - Admin: Delete reports
     - `getReportStatistics()` - Admin: Get overview statistics

4. **API Routes** ‚úÖ
   - File: `src/route/reportRoutes.js`
   - Configured all 6 endpoints
   - Public route: `POST /api/reports`
   - Admin routes: `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/reports/:reportId`
   - Statistics route: `GET /api/reports/statistics`

5. **Server Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Updated `src/server.js` to import and use report routes
   - Routes accessible at `/api/reports`

6. **Documentation** ‚úÖ
   - File: `REPORT_SYSTEM_API.md`
   - Complete API documentation with examples
   - Frontend integration guide
   - Email communication flow explanation
   - Testing instructions

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. User fills out report form on frontend
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/reports`
3. System stores report in database
4. **Admin receives email** with report details (replyTo: reporter's email)
5. **Reporter receives confirmation email**
6. Admin replies directly via email client (reply goes to reporter)

### Admin Flow

1. Admin logs into dashboard
2. Views reports at `GET /api/reports?status=pending`
3. Clicks on report to view details
4. Updates status/notes via `PATCH /api/reports/:reportId`
5. Replies to reporter directly via email (hits "Reply" button)

---

## Key Feature: Direct Email Replies

The most important feature is the **replyTo field** in admin emails:

```javascript
const mailOptions = {
    from: FROM_EMAIL,           // support@fixmo.com
    to: ADMIN_EMAIL,            // admin@fixmo.com
    replyTo: reporter_email,    // john@example.com ‚Üê CRITICAL
    subject: `[Fixmo Report #${report_id}] ${subject}`,
    html: // ... formatted email
};
```

When admin hits "Reply" in Gmail/Outlook, the response automatically goes to the reporter. No in-app messaging needed!

---

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoint (No Auth)

```
POST /api/reports
```

Submit a report from any user (customer, provider, or guest).

### Admin Endpoints (Require Admin Token)

```
GET    /api/reports                 - List all reports with filters
GET    /api/reports/statistics      - Get overview statistics
GET    /api/reports/:reportId       - Get single report
PATCH  /api/reports/:reportId       - Update report status/notes
DELETE /api/reports/:reportId       - Delete report
```

---

## Testing

### 1. Test Report Submission

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reporter_name": "John Doe",
    "reporter_email": "john@example.com",
    "report_type": "bug",
    "subject": "Test Report",
    "description": "This is a test to verify the system works.",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Report created in database
- ‚úÖ Admin receives email
- ‚úÖ Reporter receives confirmation email
- ‚úÖ Returns report ID and details

### 2. Check Admin Received Email

Look for email at ADMIN_EMAIL with:
- Subject: `[Fixmo Report #1] üêõ Bug Report - Test Report`
- Priority badge (red for urgent, yellow for high, etc.)
- Reporter contact info
- Full description
- **Reply-To: john@example.com**

### 3. Test Admin Reply

Hit "Reply" in email client and verify it addresses to `john@example.com` automatically.

### 4. Test Admin Dashboard

```bash
# Get all pending reports
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/reports?status=pending" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Update report status
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/reports/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "resolved",
    "admin_notes": "Fixed the issue"
  }'
```

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check `REPORT_SYSTEM_API.md` for detailed documentation
