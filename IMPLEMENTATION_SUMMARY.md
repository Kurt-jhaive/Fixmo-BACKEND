2. ✅ Customer exists?
3. ✅ Provider exists?
4. ✅ **Is customer trying to book with themselves?** ← NEW
5. ✅ **Already has appointment on this date?** ← NEW
6. ✅ Has 3 or more scheduled appointments?
7. ✅ Time slot available?
8. ✅ No conflicts with other bookings?

## 💡 Frontend Integration Tips

### React/React Native Example:
```javascript
const bookAppointment = async (appointmentData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/auth/appointments', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${customerToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(appointmentData)
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle specific errors
      switch (data.reason) {
        case 'self_booking_not_allowed':
          showAlert('Cannot book with yourself!');
          break;
        case 'daily_booking_limit_exceeded':
          showAlert('You already have a booking on this date!');
          break;
        default:
          showAlert(data.message);
      }
      return;
    }
    
    showSuccess('Appointment booked successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    showAlert('Network error');
  }
};
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All limits are hardcoded but can be easily modified:

```javascript
// To change daily limit (currently 1 per day):
const MAX_APPOINTMENTS_PER_DAY = 2; // Change this

// To change scheduled limit (currently 3):
if (customerScheduledAppointments >= 5) { // Change from 3 to 5
  // ...
}
```

---

## ✅ No Syntax Errors

All files have been validated:
- ✅ `authCustomerController.js` - No errors
- ✅ `appointmentController.js` - No errors
- ✅ `authCustomer.js` - No errors
