# Admin Action Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This update adds tracking of **which admin performed approval/rejection actions** across the system. Previously, the system tracked that actions were performed, but not by whom.

---

## Problem Solved

**Before:** When admins approved/rejected users, providers, certificates, or cancelled appointments, the system did not record which admin performed the action.

**After:** Every admin action now records the admin's ID in the database, creating a complete audit trail.

---

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. User Model

**New Fields:**
```prisma
verified_by_admin_id Int?       // Admin who approved/rejected verification
deactivated_by_admin_id Int?    // Admin who deactivated the user
```

**Use Cases:**
- Tracks which admin approved/rejected user verification
- Tracks which admin deactivated a user account

---

### 2. ServiceProviderDetails Model

**New Fields:**
```prisma
verified_by_admin_id    Int?    // Admin who approved/rejected verification
deactivated_by_admin_id Int?    // Admin who deactivated the provider
```

**Use Cases:**
- Tracks which admin approved/rejected provider verification
- Tracks which admin deactivated a provider account

---

### 3. Certificate Model

**New Fields:**
```prisma
reviewed_by_admin_id  Int?       // Admin who approved/rejected certificate
reviewed_at           DateTime?  // When certificate was reviewed
```

**Use Cases:**
- Tracks which admin approved/rejected a certificate
- Records timestamp of review

---

### 4. Appointment Model

**New Fields:**
```prisma
cancelled_by_admin_id Int?    // Admin who cancelled the appointment (if applicable)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Tracks which admin cancelled an appointment
- Differentiates between admin cancellations vs user/provider cancellations

---

## Controller Updates

All admin action functions now capture and store the admin ID:

### User Verification Actions

**File:** `src/controller/adminControllerNew.js`

#### 1. `verifyUser()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId; // Get from auth middleware
await prisma.user.update({
    where: { user_id: parseInt(userId) },
    data: { 
        is_verified: true,
        verification_status: 'approved',
        rejection_reason: null,
        verification_reviewed_at: new Date(),
        verified_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

#### 2. `rejectUser()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.user.update({
    where: { user_id: parseInt(userId) },
    data: { 
        is_verified: false,
        verification_status: 'rejected',
        rejection_reason: reason,
        user_reason: reason,
        verification_reviewed_at: new Date(),
        verified_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

#### 3. `deactivateUser()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.user.update({
    where: { user_id: parseInt(userId) },
    data: { 
        is_activated: false,
        user_reason: reason,
        deactivated_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

---

### Provider Verification Actions

#### 4. `verifyProvider()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.serviceProviderDetails.update({
    where: { provider_id: parseInt(providerId) },
    data: { 
        provider_isVerified: true,
        verification_status: 'approved',
        rejection_reason: null,
        verification_reviewed_at: new Date(),
        verified_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

#### 5. `rejectProvider()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;

    where: { provider_id: parseInt(providerId) },
    data: { 
        provider_isVerified: false,
        verification_status: 'rejected',
        rejection_reason: reason,
        provider_reason: reason,
        verification_reviewed_at: new Date(),
        verified_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

#### 6. `deactivateProvider()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.serviceProviderDetails.update({
    where: { provider_id: parseInt(providerId) },
    data: { 
        provider_isActivated: false,
        provider_reason: reason,
        deactivated_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

---

### Certificate Review Actions

#### 7. `approveCertificate()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.certificate.update({
    where: { certificate_id: parseInt(certificateId) },
    data: { 
        certificate_status: 'Approved',
        reviewed_by_admin_id: adminId,  // ← NEW
        reviewed_at: new Date()         // ← NEW
    }
});
```

#### 8. `rejectCertificate()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.certificate.update({
    where: { certificate_id: parseInt(certificateId) },
    data: { 
        certificate_status: 'Rejected',
        certificate_reason: reason,
        reviewed_by_admin_id: adminId,  // ← NEW
        reviewed_at: new Date()         // ← NEW
    }
});
```

---

### Appointment Cancellation

**File:** `src/controller/appointmentController.js`

#### 9. `adminCancelAppointment()`
```javascript
const adminId = req.userId;
await prisma.appointment.update({
    where: { appointment_id: parseInt(appointmentId) },
    data: { 
        appointment_status: 'cancelled',
        cancellation_reason: cancellation_reason,
        cancelled_by_admin_id: adminId  // ← NEW
    }
});
```

## Frontend Integration

### Displaying Admin Who Performed Action

```javascript
// Example: Show who approved a user
const UserApprovalInfo = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Status: {user.verification_status}</p>
      {user.verified_by_admin_id && (
        <p>Approved by Admin ID: {user.verified_by_admin_id}</p>
      )}
      {user.verification_reviewed_at && (
        <p>Reviewed on: {new Date(user.verification_reviewed_at).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// Example: Show who cancelled an appointment
const AppointmentCancellationInfo = ({ appointment }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Status: {appointment.appointment_status}</p>
      {appointment.cancelled_by_admin_id && (
        <p>Cancelled by Admin ID: {appointment.cancelled_by_admin_id}</p>
      )}
      {appointment.cancellation_reason && (
        <p>Reason: {appointment.cancellation_reason}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Fetching Admin Details

You can now join with the Admin table to show the admin's name:

```javascript
// In your admin dashboard, fetch full admin details
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { user_id: userId },
  include: {
    verified_by_admin: {
      select: {
        admin_id: true,
        admin_name: true,
        admin_email: true
      }
    }
  }
});

// Display: "Approved by: John Smith (admin@fixmo.com)"
```

**Note:** You'll need to add explicit relations in the schema if you want to use Prisma's `include` feature. For now, you can fetch the admin separately by ID.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Audit Trail
Track all admin actions for compliance and accountability:
- Who approved/rejected a user?
- Who deactivated a provider?
- Who cancelled an appointment?

### 2. Performance Tracking
Measure admin productivity:
- How many verifications did each admin process?
- Which admin handles most certificate reviews?

### 3. Issue Resolution
When investigating disputes:
- "Who approved this problematic user?"
- "Which admin cancelled this appointment?"

### 4. Admin Accountability
Ensure admins are performing their duties correctly:
- Track decision patterns
- Identify admins who reject too many/too few
- Monitor admin response times

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All fields are optional (nullable)**
- Existing records won't have admin IDs (NULL values)
- New actions from now on will have admin IDs
- No breaking changes to existing API responses
- Frontend can safely check for admin ID existence

---

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: User Approval
```bash
# 1. Login as admin
POST /api/admin/login
{
  "admin_username": "admin1",
  "admin_password": "password"
}

# 2. Approve a user
POST /api/admin/users/:userId/verify
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

# 3. Check database
SELECT user_id, verification_status, verified_by_admin_id 
FROM "User" 
WHERE user_id = 5;

# Expected: verified_by_admin_id = 1 (the logged-in admin)
```

### Test Scenario 2: Certificate Rejection
```bash
# 1. Login as admin
# 2. Reject a certificate
POST /api/admin/certificates/:certId/reject
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
{
  "reason": "Invalid certificate format"
}

# 3. Check database
SELECT certificate_id, certificate_status, reviewed_by_admin_id, reviewed_at
FROM "Certificate"
WHERE certificate_id = 10;

# Expected: 
# - reviewed_by_admin_id = 1
# - reviewed_at = current timestamp
```

### Test Scenario 3: Appointment Cancellation
```bash
# 1. Login as admin
# 2. Cancel appointment
POST /api/admin/appointments/:appointmentId/cancel
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
{
  "cancellation_reason": "Provider no longer available"
}

# 3. Check database
SELECT appointment_id, appointment_status, cancelled_by_admin_id
FROM "Appointment"
WHERE appointment_id = 20;

# Expected: cancelled_by_admin_id = 1
```

## Admin Reports (Future Enhancement)

With this data, you can now create admin performance reports:

```sql
-- Count approvals by admin
SELECT 
  a.admin_id,
  a.admin_name,
  COUNT(u.user_id) as user_approvals,
  COUNT(p.provider_id) as provider_approvals,
  COUNT(c.certificate_id) as certificate_approvals
FROM "Admin" a
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON u.verified_by_admin_id = a.admin_id
LEFT JOIN "ServiceProviderDetails" p ON p.verified_by_admin_id = a.admin_id
LEFT JOIN "Certificate" c ON c.reviewed_by_admin_id = a.admin_id
GROUP BY a.admin_id, a.admin_name
ORDER BY (COUNT(u.user_id) + COUNT(p.provider_id) + COUNT(c.certificate_id)) DESC;
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Schema Updated:** 4 models modified with 7 new fields
✅ **Migration Applied:** `20251012172408_add_admin_tracking_fields`
✅ **Controllers Updated:** 9 functions now capture admin ID
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Existing records unaffected
✅ **Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of admin actions

**This is a BACKEND fix** - the data is now being tracked in the database. The frontend can display this information by accessing the new fields in API responses.

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added admin tracking fields
2. ✅ `src/controller/adminControllerNew.js` - Updated 8 functions
3. ✅ `src/controller/appointmentController.js` - Updated 1 function
4. ✅ Migration created: `20251012172408_add_admin_tracking_fields`

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

To fully utilize this data in the admin panel:

1. **Add Admin Relations in Schema** (optional):
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  verified_by_admin Admin? @relation("UserVerifications", fields: [verified_by_admin_id], references: [admin_id])
  deactivated_by_admin Admin? @relation("UserDeactivations", fields: [deactivated_by_admin_id], references: [admin_id])
}
```

2. **Create Admin Activity Report Endpoint**:
```javascript
GET /api/admin/reports/activity
// Returns admin action statistics
```

3. **Add Admin Activity Log Viewer** in frontend admin panel

4. **Create Audit Trail Page** showing all admin actions with timestamps

---

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Complete and Working**

All admin actions now track which admin performed them. The data is stored in the database and returned in API responses.
