1. Show rejection reason prominently
2. Display "Re-submit Verification" button
3. On click:
   - Open image picker
   - Upload to Cloudinary
   - Call `/api/verification/customer/resubmit` with URL
   - Show success message
   - Status changes to "pending"

### Admin Dashboard (React/Web)

Display pending verifications with:
- User/Provider info
- ID/Certificate images
- "Approve" button
- "Reject" button that opens text input for reason
- Filter by type (customer/provider)
- Show submission date
