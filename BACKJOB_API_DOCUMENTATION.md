- Appointments with status `in-warranty` or `backjob` are checked for expiry
- Expired appointments are automatically marked as `completed`
- Any active backjob applications are cancelled with status `cancelled-by-admin`

### Evidence File Requirements
- All backjob applications **must** include evidence (photos/videos or detailed description)
- Files are uploaded separately using the evidence upload endpoint
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP (images), MP4, MPEG, MOV, AVI, WEBM (videos)

- **Admin endpoints**: Require admin JWT with appropriate permissions

### Error Handling
- All endpoints return consistent JSON error responses
- Email failures are logged but don't prevent operations
- Validation errors provide clear feedback
- Authentication/authorization errors return appropriate HTTP codes

- Include evidence (photos, videos) when possible
- Be available for follow-up questions during disputes

### For Providers
- Respond promptly to backjob notifications (within 24 hours)
- Provide clear documentation when disputing claims
- Honor valid warranty claims to maintain service quality

### for Administrators
- Review disputed claims thoroughly and fairly
- Document decisions clearly in admin notes
- Monitor backjob patterns for service quality insights

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

The backjob system provides insights into:
- **Service Quality**: Track warranty claim rates by provider
- **Dispute Resolution**: Monitor dispute outcomes and patterns  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyze backjob frequency and reasons
- **Provider Performance**: Evaluate response times and dispute rates

This comprehensive system ensures fair and efficient handling of warranty claims while maintaining high service standards for the Fixmo platform.
- Query:
  - `status` (optional; filter)
  - `page` (default 1)
  - `limit` (default 10)
- Response: `{ success, data: [ ... ], pagination: { current_page, total_pages, total_count, limit } }`

### 4) Update Backjob Status (Admin)
- Method: PATCH

- Auth: `admin`
- Body:
  - `action`: one of `approve` | `cancel-by-admin` | `cancel-by-user`
  - `admin_notes` (string, optional)
- Effects:
  - `approve` â†’ backjob `approved`; appointment stays `backjob` until rescheduled by provider
  - `cancel-by-admin` â†’ backjob `cancelled-by-admin`; appointment becomes `completed`
  - `cancel-by-user` â†’ backjob `cancelled-by-user`; appointment returns to `in-warranty`

### 5) Reschedule From Backjob (Provider)
- Method: PATCH
- Path: `/api/appointments/:appointmentId/reschedule-backjob`
- Auth: `provider` (must match appointment provider)
- Body:
  - `new_scheduled_date` (ISO string, required)
  - `availability_id` (number, required)
- Preconditions:
  - Appointment status is `backjob`
  - There exists an `approved` backjob for the appointment
  - No provider conflict at the chosen time
- Response: `{ success, message, data: appointment }` (includes `customer`, `serviceProvider`, `service`) with status `scheduled`.

## Status Reference

- Appointment statuses used in this flow: `in-warranty`, `backjob`, `scheduled`, `completed`.

## Notes
