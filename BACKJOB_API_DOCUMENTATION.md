# Backjob (Warranty Claims) API Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for all backjob-related API endpoints in the Fixmo backend system. The backjob system manages warranty claims where customers can request additional service work if issues persist after the initial appointment completion.

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Authentication
All endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Backjob Workflow

### System Flow
1. **Customer applies for backjob** â†’ Auto-approved immediately
2. **Provider receives notification** â†’ Can reschedule OR dispute
3. **If provider reschedules** â†’ New appointment created, emails sent
4. **If provider disputes** â†’ Customer notified, admin review required
5. **Admin resolves disputes** â†’ Final decision made

### Auto-Approval Feature
- All backjob applications are **automatically approved** when submitted
- No manual admin approval required for initial applications
- Providers can still dispute if they believe work was completed correctly

## Monitoring & Analytics

The backjob system provides insights into:
- **Service Quality**: Track warranty claim rates by provider

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyze backjob frequency and reasons
- **Provider Performance**: Evaluate response times and dispute rates

This comprehensive system ensures fair and efficient handling of warranty claims while maintaining high service standards for the Fixmo platform.
- Query:
  - `status` (optional; filter)
  - `page` (default 1)
  - `limit` (default 10)
- Response: `{ success, data: [ ... ], pagination: { current_page, total_pages, total_count, limit } }`

### 4) Update Backjob Status (Admin)

- Auth: `admin`
- Body:
  - `action`: one of `approve` | `cancel-by-admin` | `cancel-by-user`
  - `admin_notes` (string, optional)
- Effects:
  - `approve` â†’ backjob `approved`; appointment stays `backjob` until rescheduled by provider
  - `cancel-by-admin` â†’ backjob `cancelled-by-admin`; appointment becomes `completed`
  - `cancel-by-user` â†’ backjob `cancelled-by-user`; appointment returns to `in-warranty`

### 5) Reschedule From Backjob (Provider)
- Method: PATCH

- Auth: `provider` (must match appointment provider)
- Body:
  - `new_scheduled_date` (ISO string, required)
  - `availability_id` (number, required)
- Preconditions:
  - Appointment status is `backjob`
  - There exists an `approved` backjob for the appointment
  - No provider conflict at the chosen time
- Response: `{ success, message, data: appointment }` (includes `customer`, `serviceProvider`, `service`) with status `scheduled`.

## Status Reference
- Backjob status: `pending` (default), `approved`, `disputed`, `cancelled-by-admin`, `cancelled-by-user`.
- Appointment statuses used in this flow: `in-warranty`, `backjob`, `scheduled`, `completed`.

## Notes
- Evidence fields accept JSON to support arrays of links, objects, etc.
- All IDs in path params are numeric.
- Appointment ID remains the same throughout the backjob rescheduling.
