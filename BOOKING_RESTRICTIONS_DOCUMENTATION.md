# Booking Restrictions & Self-Booking Prevention

## Overview
This document describes the booking restrictions and self-booking prevention features implemented in the Fixmo backend to ensure a better user experience and prevent misuse.

---

## üö´ Feature 1: Self-Booking Prevention

### Description
Customers cannot book appointments with themselves when they have both a customer account and a service provider account with matching details.

### Matching Criteria
A customer and provider are considered the same person if:
- **First name** AND **Last name** match (case-insensitive, trimmed)
- **AND** (**Email** matches **OR** **Phone number** matches)

### Implementation Locations
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `createAppointment()` function
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `addAppointment()` function
- ‚úÖ `appointmentController.js` ‚Üí `createAppointment()` function

### API Response

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You cannot book an appointment with yourself. Please select a different service provider.",
  "reason": "self_booking_not_allowed"
}
```

### Console Logging
```
üö´ SELF-BOOKING PREVENTED: {
  customer: 'john doe',
  provider: 'john doe',
  email_match: true,
  phone_match: true
}
```

### Example Scenarios

| Customer Name | Customer Email | Provider Name | Provider Email | Result |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| John Doe | john@mail.com | John Doe | john@mail.com | ‚ùå BLOCKED |
| John Doe | john@mail.com | John Doe | different@mail.com | ‚úÖ ALLOWED (different email AND phone) |
| John Doe | john@mail.com | Jane Smith | john@mail.com | ‚úÖ ALLOWED (different names) |

---

## üìÖ Feature 2: Daily Booking Limit (One Appointment Per Day)

### Description
Customers can only book **ONE appointment per day**. This prevents customers from booking multiple appointments on the same date, reducing scheduling conflicts and ensuring fair access.

### Rules
- ‚úÖ Customers can only have one active appointment per day
- ‚úÖ Cancelled appointments don't count toward the limit
- ‚úÖ The check is based on the scheduled date (not time)
- ‚úÖ Dates are compared from midnight to midnight (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)

### Implementation Locations
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `createAppointment()` function
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `addAppointment()` function
- ‚úÖ `appointmentController.js` ‚Üí `createAppointment()` function

### API Response

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You already have an appointment scheduled on this date. You can only book one appointment per day.",
  "reason": "daily_booking_limit_exceeded",
  "existing_appointment": {
    "appointment_id": 123,
    "scheduled_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00.000Z",
    "status": "scheduled"
  }
}
```

### Console Logging
```
üö´ DAILY BOOKING LIMIT EXCEEDED: {
  customer_id: 45,
  requested_date: '2025-10-15',
  existing_appointment_id: 123,
  existing_appointment_time: 2025-10-15T10:00:00.000Z
}
```

### Excluded Appointment Statuses
The following statuses **DO NOT** count toward the daily limit:
- `Cancelled`
- `cancelled`

### Example Scenarios

| Scenario | Existing Appointment | New Booking Request | Result |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Customer books first appointment | None | 2025-10-15 @ 10:00 AM | ‚úÖ ALLOWED |
| Customer tries to book second appointment on same day | 2025-10-15 @ 10:00 AM | 2025-10-15 @ 2:00 PM | ‚ùå BLOCKED |
| Customer cancelled previous appointment | 2025-10-15 @ 10:00 AM (Cancelled) | 2025-10-15 @ 2:00 PM | ‚úÖ ALLOWED |
| Customer books on different day | 2025-10-15 @ 10:00 AM | 2025-10-16 @ 10:00 AM | ‚úÖ ALLOWED |

## üîç Feature 3: Service Listings Self-Exclusion Filter

### Description
When customers browse service listings, their own provider accounts (if they have one) are automatically excluded from search results.

### Implementation Location
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `getServiceListingsForCustomer()` function
- ‚úÖ `authCustomer.js` route ‚Üí Uses `optionalAuth` middleware

### How It Works
1. Customer provides JWT token when browsing (optional)
2. System fetches customer details (name, email, phone)
3. Service listings are filtered to exclude matching providers
4. Results are returned without the customer's provider account

### Authentication
- **Optional**: Works with or without authentication
- **With token**: Filters out customer's own provider account
- **Without token**: Shows all service listings (no filtering)

### API Endpoint
```
GET /auth/service-listings
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <customer_token> (optional)
```

### Console Logging
```
üîç Customer authenticated: { userId: 123, name: 'John Doe' }
üö´ Excluding provider (same person as customer): {
  provider_id: 45,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
}
‚úÖ Self-exclusion filter applied: 1 provider(s) excluded
```

## üìä Feature 4: Scheduled Appointments Limit

### Description
Customers can only have **3 active scheduled appointments** at a time. This limit only applies to appointments with status `scheduled`.

### Rules
- ‚úÖ Maximum 3 appointments with status `scheduled`
- ‚úÖ Other statuses don't count toward the limit:
  - `on the way` / `on-the-way`
  - `in-progress`
  - `completed` / `finished`
  - `cancelled` / `Cancelled`

### Implementation Locations
- ‚úÖ `authCustomerController.js` ‚Üí `createAppointment()` function

### API Response

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Booking limit reached. You can only have 3 scheduled appointments at a time. Please wait for one of your appointments to change status (on the way, in-progress, completed, or cancelled) before booking again.",
  "currentScheduledCount": 3,
  "maxAllowed": 3
}
```

### Console Logging
```
üîç BOOKING CHECK - Customer scheduled appointments count: 3
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Validation Order (All Appointment Creation Functions)

1. ‚úÖ **Required fields validation** - Check all required parameters
2. ‚úÖ **Customer exists** - Verify customer account
3. ‚úÖ **Provider exists** - Verify provider account
4. ‚úÖ **Self-booking prevention** - Check if customer = provider
5. ‚úÖ **Daily booking limit** - Check one appointment per day
6. ‚úÖ **Scheduled appointments limit** - Check max 3 scheduled (only in `createAppointment`)
7. ‚úÖ **Time slot availability** - Check provider availability
8. ‚úÖ **Conflicting appointments** - Check provider schedule conflicts

### Database Queries

#### Self-Booking Check
```javascript
const customer = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { user_id: parseInt(customer_id) },
  select: { first_name, last_name, email, phone_number }
});

const provider = await prisma.serviceProviderDetails.findUnique({
  where: { provider_id: parseInt(provider_id) },
  select: { provider_first_name, provider_last_name, provider_email, provider_phone_number }
});
```

#### Daily Booking Limit Check
```javascript
const existingBookingOnDate = await prisma.appointment.findFirst({
  where: {
    customer_id: parseInt(customer_id),
    scheduled_date: {
      gte: startOfDay,
      lt: endOfDay
    },
    appointment_status: {
      notIn: ['Cancelled', 'cancelled']
    }
  }
});
```

#### Scheduled Appointments Limit Check
```javascript
const customerScheduledAppointments = await prisma.appointment.count({
  where: {
    customer_id: parseInt(customerId),
    appointment_status: 'scheduled'
  }
});
```

## üì± Frontend Integration

### Handling Self-Booking Error
```javascript
try {
  const response = await bookAppointment(appointmentData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.reason === 'self_booking_not_allowed') {
    showAlert('You cannot book appointments with yourself. Please select a different provider.');
  }
}
```

### Handling Daily Limit Error
```javascript
try {
  const response = await bookAppointment(appointmentData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.reason === 'daily_booking_limit_exceeded') {
    const existingDate = new Date(error.existing_appointment.scheduled_date);
    showAlert(
      `You already have an appointment on ${existingDate.toLocaleDateString()}. ` +
      `You can only book one appointment per day.`
    );
  }
}
```

### Displaying Service Listings
```javascript
// Simply include the customer token if available
const response = await fetch('/auth/service-listings', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': customerToken ? `Bearer ${customerToken}` : undefined
  }
});
// Customer's own provider account will be automatically filtered out
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Self-Booking Prevention
```bash
# Create customer account: John Doe, john@mail.com
# Create provider account: John Doe, john@mail.com
# Try to book appointment as customer with that provider
# Expected: 400 error with "self_booking_not_allowed"
```

#### 2. Daily Booking Limit
```bash
# Book appointment for 2025-10-15 @ 10:00 AM
# Try to book another appointment for 2025-10-15 @ 2:00 PM
# Expected: 400 error with "daily_booking_limit_exceeded"

# Cancel first appointment
# Try to book again for 2025-10-15 @ 2:00 PM
# Expected: 200 success (cancelled appointments don't count)
```

#### 3. Service Listings Filter
```bash
# Login as customer (get JWT token)
# Browse service listings with Authorization header
# Expected: Customer's own provider account not in results

# Browse without Authorization header
# Expected: All providers shown (including own account)
```

#### 4. Scheduled Appointments Limit
```bash
# Book 3 appointments with status "scheduled"
# Try to book 4th appointment
# Expected: 400 error with booking limit message

# Change one appointment status to "on-the-way"
# Try to book 4th appointment
# Expected: 200 success (only "scheduled" status counts)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Current Limits
- **Daily appointments per customer**: 1 per day
- **Max scheduled appointments**: 3 at a time
- **Self-booking**: Not allowed

### To Modify Limits

**Change daily limit** (currently hardcoded to 1):
```javascript
// In createAppointment/addAppointment functions
// Add this to allow multiple per day:
const MAX_APPOINTMENTS_PER_DAY = 2; // Change to desired limit
```

**Change scheduled appointments limit**:
```javascript
// In createAppointment function
if (customerScheduledAppointments >= 5) { // Change from 3 to desired limit
  return res.status(400).json({...});
}
```
