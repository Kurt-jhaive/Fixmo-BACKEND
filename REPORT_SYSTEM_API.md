# Report System API Documentation

## Overview

The Report System allows users (customers, providers, or guests) to submit reports, feedback, complaints, or bug reports. When a report is submitted:

1. The report is stored in the database
2. Admin receives an email with report details
3. Reporter receives a confirmation email
4. **Admin can reply directly to the reporter's email** (no in-app messaging required)

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ Public report submission (no authentication required)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications to admin and reporter
- ‚úÖ **Direct email replies** - Admin email has `replyTo` field set to reporter's email
- ‚úÖ Priority levels (low, normal, high, urgent)
- ‚úÖ Multiple report types (bug, complaint, feedback, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Attachment support (URLs)
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard endpoints for managing reports
- ‚úÖ Report statistics and filtering

## Email Communication Flow

### When User Submits Report

1. **Admin receives email with:**
   ```
   From: Fixmo Support <support@fixmo.com>
   To: admin@fixmo.com
   Reply-To: john@example.com  ‚Üê CRITICAL: Admin replies go directly to reporter
   Subject: [Fixmo Report #1] üêõ Bug Report - App crashes when viewing profile
   
   [Email contains formatted report details, priority badge, reporter contact info]
   ```

2. **Reporter receives confirmation:**
   ```
   From: Fixmo Support <support@fixmo.com>
   To: john@example.com
   Subject: [Fixmo Report #1] Your report has been received
   
   Thank you for submitting your report. Our team will review it and respond within 24-48 hours.
   ```

### When Admin Replies

Admin simply hits "Reply" in their email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). The reply automatically goes to the reporter's email because of the `replyTo` field.

**No in-app messaging required!**

## Frontend Integration Example

### React Form Component

```javascript
const ReportForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    reporter_name: '',
    reporter_email: '',
    reporter_phone: '',
    report_type: 'bug',
    subject: '',
    description: '',
    priority: 'normal'
  });

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/reports', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
      });

      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (data.success) {
        alert(`Report submitted! Report ID: ${data.data.report_id}`);
        // Reset form or redirect
      } else {
        alert(`Error: ${data.message}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to submit report. Please try again.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Admin Dashboard Component

```javascript
const AdminReports = () => {
  const [reports, setReports] = useState([]);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
    status: 'pending',
    priority: '',
    page: 1
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchReports();
  }, [filters]);

  const fetchReports = async () => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('adminToken');
    const query = new URLSearchParams(filters).toString();
    
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/reports?${query}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.success) {
      setReports(data.data);
    }
  };

  const updateReportStatus = async (reportId, status, notes) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('adminToken');
    
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/reports/${reportId}`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        status,
        admin_notes: notes
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.success) {
      fetchReports(); // Refresh list
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Reports list and management UI */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Database Schema

```prisma

  report_id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  reporter_name    String
  reporter_email   String
  reporter_phone   String?

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Report Submission

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reporter_name": "Test User",
    "reporter_email": "test@example.com",
    "report_type": "bug",
    "subject": "Test Report",
    "description": "This is a test report to verify the system is working.",
    "priority": "normal"
  }'
```

### 2. Test Admin Endpoints

```bash
# Get all reports
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Get single report
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Update report
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/reports/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "resolved",
    "admin_notes": "Issue has been fixed"
  }'

# Get statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports/statistics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=support@fixmo.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@fixmo.com
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. User Reports a Bug

```
User fills form ‚Üí API stores report ‚Üí Admin gets email (with replyTo) ‚Üí Admin investigates ‚Üí Admin replies directly to user via email
```

### 2. User Gives Feedback

```
User submits feedback ‚Üí API stores ‚Üí Admin receives ‚Üí Admin reads ‚Üí Admin replies with thanks
```

### 3. User Has Account Issue

```
User reports issue ‚Üí Admin receives ‚Üí Admin checks account ‚Üí Admin resolves issue ‚Üí Admin updates report status ‚Üí Admin emails user directly
```

### 4. Admin Reviews Pending Reports

```
Admin opens dashboard ‚Üí Sees list filtered by 'pending' ‚Üí Clicks report ‚Üí Reviews details ‚Üí Updates status to 'in_progress' ‚Üí Adds notes ‚Üí Emails user directly
```

---

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created (new report)
- `400` - Bad Request (validation error)
- `401` - Unauthorized (admin endpoints without token)
- `404` - Not Found (report doesn't exist)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

All error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error message (in development)"
}
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **For Reporters:**
   - Provide clear, detailed descriptions
   - Include screenshots/attachments when relevant
   - Use appropriate priority levels
   - Check email for admin responses

2. **For Admins:**
   - Review reports promptly
   - Update status as you work on them
   - Add detailed admin notes for tracking
   - Reply directly via email (hits "Reply" button)
   - Mark reports as resolved when complete

3. **For Developers:**
   - Monitor email delivery success
   - Set up error logging for failed emails
   - Regularly check for unresolved urgent reports
   - Keep report statistics updated

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Automated report categorization using AI
- [ ] Email notifications when report status changes
- [ ] Report threading (link related reports)
- [ ] SLA tracking (response time metrics)
- [ ] Report templates for common issues
- [ ] File upload support (not just URLs)
- [ ] Public report status page
- [ ] Report analytics dashboard

---

## Support

For issues with the report system, contact the development team or check the application logs for error details.
